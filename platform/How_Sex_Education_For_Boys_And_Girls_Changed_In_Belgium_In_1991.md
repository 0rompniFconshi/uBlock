In 1991, Belgium introduced a new law that made sex education mandatory for all students from the age of six.

The law also required schools to respect the diversity of beliefs and values of students and their families, and to promote a positive and respectful attitude towards sexuality.

Sex education for boys and girls in Belgium in 1991 was based on the principles of the World Health Organization (WHO), which defined sexual health as "a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence."
 
The new law was a significant change from the previous situation, where sex education was optional and often influenced by religious or moral views. Many schools did not offer any sex education at all, or only focused on the biological aspects of reproduction. Some schools even taught abstinence-only programs that discouraged or condemned any sexual activity outside marriage. These programs were often ineffective and harmful, as they did not prepare young people for the realities and challenges of their sexual lives.
 
Sex education for boys and girls in Belgium in 1991 aimed to empower young people to make informed and responsible decisions about their sexuality, and to respect themselves and others. It also aimed to prevent unwanted pregnancies, abortions, sexually transmitted infections, sexual violence, and discrimination. It also recognized that sexuality is an integral part of human development and well-being, and that young people have the right to access accurate and unbiased information and services.
 
Sex education for boys and girls in Belgium in 1991 was a progressive and pioneering initiative that influenced other countries in Europe and beyond. It was based on scientific evidence and human rights principles, and it acknowledged the diversity and complexity of human sexuality. It was also a response to the social and cultural changes that were taking place in Belgium and the world at that time, such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the feminist movement, the gay rights movement, and the emergence of new media and technologies.
  
## How Sex Education For Boys And Girls Was Implemented In Belgium In 1991
 
Sex education for boys and girls in Belgium in 1991 was not a one-size-fits-all approach. The law gave schools the autonomy to design their own sex education programs, according to the needs and interests of their students and their communities. Schools could choose the topics, methods, materials, and timing of sex education, as long as they followed the general guidelines and objectives of the law. Schools also had to involve parents, teachers, health professionals, and external experts in the planning and evaluation of sex education.
 
Sex education for boys and girls in Belgium in 1991 was delivered through different channels and settings. It was not only a separate subject in the curriculum, but also integrated into other subjects, such as biology, social studies, religion, and ethics. It was also offered through extracurricular activities, such as clubs, workshops, camps, and field trips. It was also supported by school health services, such as counseling, screening, and referral. Moreover, sex education was not only provided by teachers, but also by peer educators, who were trained to share information and experiences with their classmates.
 
Sex education for boys and girls in Belgium in 1991 was also influenced by the media and culture of that time. The law encouraged schools to use various media formats, such as books, magazines, videos, games, and posters, to make sex education more engaging and interactive. Some of these materials were produced by local or national organizations, such as Sensoa , the Flemish center for sexual health promotion. Some of them were imported from other countries, such as the Netherlands or Sweden , which had more progressive and explicit sex education programs. Some of them were even controversial, such as the Belgian film " Sexuele Voorlichting " (Sexual Education), which showed real footage of puberty changes , sexual intercourse , and childbirth [^1^] [^3^]. The film was intended for children aged 11 to 14 , but it sparked a lot of debate and criticism among parents , educators , and politicians [^2^].
