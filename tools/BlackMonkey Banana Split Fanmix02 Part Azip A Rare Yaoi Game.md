Banana Split Fanmix.02 Part A.zip is a sequel to Banana Split Fanmix.01, which was a collection of short stories featuring the characters from BlackMonkey's previous games. Part A.zip focuses on the relationship between Mikkun and Kyouhei, two high school students who are members of the swimming club. The game is divided into two parts: a visual novel segment where the player can choose different options to interact with Mikkun and Kyouhei, and a mini-game segment where the player can control Mikkun's actions during sex scenes.
 
The game is notable for its high-quality art and animation, as well as its explicit and varied sexual content. The game also has a humorous tone and some references to other BlackMonkey games and characters. However, the game is also very short and has no voice acting or sound effects. The game is also hard to find online, as BlackMonkey disbanded in 2016 and their official website and social media accounts are no longer active.
